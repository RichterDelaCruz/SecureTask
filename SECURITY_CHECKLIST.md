# SecureTask Authentication Security Checklist

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] **Session-based authentication** with secure session configuration
- [x] **Role-based authorization** middleware (Administrator, Project Manager, Employee)
- [x] **Automatic session logout** after 8 hours of inactivity
- [x] **Session regeneration** to prevent session fixation attacks
- [x] **Route protection** - all routes except login/register require authentication

### Password Security
- [x] **Strong password hashing** using bcrypt with 12 rounds (cryptographically strong)
- [x] **Password complexity requirements**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter  
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- [x] **Password reuse prevention** - stores last 5 password hashes
- [x] **Password age requirement** - minimum 24 hours between changes
- [x] **UI password masking** - all password fields use type="password"

### Account Security
- [x] **Account lockout** after 5 failed login attempts for 15 minutes
- [x] **Login attempt tracking** with failed login timestamps
- [x] **Last login display** shown to users after successful authentication
- [x] **Generic error messages** - "Invalid username or password" for all auth failures
- [x] **Timing attack protection** - consistent response times for login attempts

### Re-authentication
- [x] **Critical action protection** - password changes require current password confirmation
- [x] **Re-authentication timeout** - 5 minute window for critical actions
- [x] **Secure password verification** for re-auth

### Security Logging & Monitoring
- [x] **Comprehensive security logging** for all authentication events
- [x] **Failed login attempt logging** with IP and user agent tracking
- [x] **Account lockout logging**
- [x] **Password change logging**
- [x] **Unauthorized access attempt logging**

### Infrastructure Security
- [x] **Rate limiting** - 100 requests per 15 minutes globally, 50 login attempts per 15 minutes
- [x] **Security headers** via Helmet.js with strict CSP
- [x] **HTTPS enforcement** in production
- [x] **Secure cookie configuration** with HttpOnly, SameSite, and Secure flags
- [x] **Input validation and sanitization** using express-validator
- [x] **XSS protection** through input escaping and CSP headers

### Error Handling
- [x] **Secure error responses** - no stack traces or sensitive info leaked to users
- [x] **Consistent error messaging** across authentication flows
- [x] **Proper error logging** for debugging without exposing sensitive data

### Password Reset Protection
- [x] **No predictable reset questions** - no password reset mechanism implemented
- [x] **No weak recovery methods** - secure by design with no reset functionality

## üîí Security Best Practices Followed

1. **Fail securely** - All authentication logic defaults to denial
2. **Defense in depth** - Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Principle of least privilege** - Role-based access control
4. **Secure by default** - Conservative security settings
5. **Input validation** - All user inputs validated and sanitized
6. **Output encoding** - Proper escaping to prevent XSS
7. **Session management** - Secure session handling with regeneration
8. **Audit logging** - Comprehensive security event logging
9. **Rate limiting** - Protection against brute force attacks
10. **Timing attack mitigation** - Consistent response times

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

- **No username enumeration** - Same response for valid/invalid usernames
- **Session fixation protection** - Session ID regeneration
- **CSRF protection** - SameSite cookie attribute
- **Password strength enforcement** - Complex regex validation
- **Account monitoring** - Failed attempt tracking and display
- **Secure development practices** - No hardcoded secrets, proper error handling

## üìã Deployment Security Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Set SESSION_SECRET in production
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled in production (secure cookies)
3. **Database Security**: SQLite database with prepared statements (SQL injection protection)
4. **Monitoring**: Security logs are stored in database and files for monitoring
5. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated for security patches

This implementation exceeds industry standards for web application authentication security.
