# Password Age Restriction Implementation

## Security Requirement 2.1.11

**Requirement**: Passwords should be at least one day old before they can be changed, to prevent attacks on password re-use.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview

The SecureTask application fully implements password age restrictions to prevent password reuse attacks. This security control ensures that users cannot rapidly cycle through passwords to circumvent password history restrictions.

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema
- **Column**: `password_changed_at` (DATETIME) in the `users` table
- **Purpose**: Tracks when each user's password was last changed
- **Default**: Set to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` on password creation/update

#### Backend Implementation

1. **Database Helper Function** (`database/init.js`):
   ```javascript
   canChangePassword: (userId, callback) => {
       db.get(
           `SELECT password_changed_at, 
                   datetime(password_changed_at, '+1 day') <= datetime('now') as can_change
            FROM users WHERE id = ?`,
           [userId],
           callback
       );
   }
   ```

2. **Password Update Function** (`database/init.js`):
   ```javascript
   updateUserPassword: (userId, newPasswordHash, callback) => {
       db.run(
           "UPDATE users SET password_hash = ?, updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, password_changed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = ?",
           [newPasswordHash, userId],
           callback
       );
   }
   ```

3. **Route Protection** (`routes/account.js`):
   - Password change requests check `canChangePassword()` before processing
   - If less than 24 hours since last change, request is blocked
   - User receives clear error message with time remaining

#### Security Features

- **Minimum Age**: 24 hours (1 day) enforced
- **Precision**: Hour-level granularity for user feedback
- **Security Logging**: All blocked attempts are logged
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages indicate time remaining

#### Error Handling

When a password change is attempted too soon:
- **Message**: "Password was changed recently. You must wait at least 24 hours between password changes. Try again in X hour(s)."
- **Logging**: Security event logged with details
- **Redirect**: User returned to password change form with error

### Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Password Cycling**: Users cannot rapidly change passwords to bypass history restrictions
2. **Enforces Deliberate Changes**: Encourages thoughtful password selection
3. **Reduces Automated Attacks**: Prevents scripted password cycling attempts
4. **Compliance**: Meets enterprise security requirements for password management

### Testing and Verification

The implementation has been thoroughly tested:

1. **Age Calculation**: SQLite datetime functions correctly calculate 24-hour periods
2. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions around the 24-hour mark
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messaging and time remaining display
4. **Security Logging**: All events properly logged for audit trails

### Usage Example

1. User changes password on Day 1 at 2:00 PM
2. User attempts to change password on Day 2 at 1:00 PM (23 hours later)
3. System blocks the attempt: "Try again in 1 hour(s)"
4. User can successfully change password on Day 2 at 2:00 PM (24+ hours later)

### Integration Points

- **Authentication Flow**: Works seamlessly with existing password validation
- **Authorization**: Integrated with permission-based access controls
- **Audit Trail**: All attempts logged in security logs
- **Rate Limiting**: Compatible with sensitive operation rate limits

### Compliance Status

✅ **OWASP**: Follows password management best practices  
✅ **Enterprise Security**: Meets corporate password policy requirements  
✅ **Audit Requirements**: Full logging and monitoring implemented  
✅ **User Experience**: Clear feedback without security information disclosure  

This implementation fully satisfies security requirement 2.1.11 and enhances the overall password security posture of the SecureTask application.
