# SecureTask Authorization Implementation - Security Checklist

## ✅ Centralized Access Control
- **Implemented**: `middleware/authorization.js` provides centralized permission system
- **Features**: 
  - Permission-based access control through `requirePermission()`
  - Role-based mapping in `PERMISSIONS` object
  - Resource ownership validation through `requireResourceOwnership()`
  - Business logic validation through `validateBusinessLogic()`

## ✅ Fail-Secure Approach
- **Implementation**: All middleware functions check authentication first
- **Behavior**: 
  - Unauthenticated users → redirect to `/login`
  - Unauthorized users → 403 error page with generic message
  - Invalid session data → session destruction and redirect to login
  - Database errors → access denied with security logging

## ✅ Role-Based Access Logic
- **Roles Implemented**:
  - **Administrator**: System management, user creation, audit logs
  - **Project Manager**: Task creation, assignment, management of created tasks
  - **Employee**: View assigned tasks, update task status
- **Permission Mapping**: Granular permissions per role in `PERMISSIONS` object

## ✅ Business Logic Enforcement
- **Task Management Rules**:
  - Project Managers can only edit/delete tasks they created
  - Employees can only update status of tasks assigned to them
  - Tasks can only be assigned to users with "Employee" role
  - Managers cannot delete themselves or administrators
- **Implementation**: `canDeleteManager()`, `canAssignTaskToUser()` validators

## ✅ Server-Verified Session Data
- **Session Integrity**: `validateSessionIntegrity()` middleware validates:
  - Required session fields (id, username, role)
  - Valid role values
  - Session data corruption detection
- **Access Decisions**: All authorization based on `req.session.user` data

## ✅ No Sensitive Data Leakage
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages for unauthorized access
- **Security Headers**: Added comprehensive security headers via `addSecurityHeaders()`
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed security event logging without exposing sensitive data

## ✅ Proper Redirects and Error Handling
- **Unauthenticated Users**: Redirect to `/login`
- **Unauthorized Users**: Show error page with appropriate message
- **Session Issues**: Clean session destruction and redirect to login
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse with proper error responses

## ✅ Integration with Existing Authentication
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing `authenticateUser` middleware
- **Session Management**: Integrates with existing session configuration
- **Database Integration**: Uses existing `dbHelpers` for data access
- **Logging Integration**: Uses existing `securityLogger` for audit trails

## Enhanced Security Features Added

### 1. Advanced Security Headers
```javascript
addSecurityHeaders() middleware adds:
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (MIME sniffing protection)
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block (XSS protection)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin (privacy)
```

### 2. Rate Limiting for Sensitive Operations
```javascript
sensitiveOperationLimiter() provides:
- Password change: 5 attempts per 30 minutes
- Manager creation: 3 attempts per hour
- Manager deletion: 2 attempts per hour
```

### 3. Comprehensive Audit Logging
```javascript
auditAuthorizationEvent() tracks:
- Authentication events
- Authorization decisions
- Session integrity checks
- Rate limit violations
- Security policy violations
```

### 4. Session Integrity Validation
```javascript
validateSessionIntegrity() ensures:
- Required session fields present
- Valid role values
- Session corruption detection
- Automatic cleanup of invalid sessions
```

## Route Protection Summary

### Authentication Required Routes
- `/dashboard/*` - All dashboard functionality
- `/admin/*` - Administrative functions
- `/account/*` - Account management
- `/logout` - Logout functionality

### Permission-Protected Routes

#### Administrator Only
- `/admin/managers` - Manager account management (admin:manage-managers)
- `/admin/logs` - System audit logs (admin:view-logs)
- `/admin/create-manager` - Create manager accounts (admin:manage-managers)
- `/admin/delete-manager` - Delete manager accounts (admin:manage-managers)

#### Project Manager Only
- `/dashboard/create-task` - Create new tasks (task:create)
- `/dashboard/reassign-task` - Reassign tasks (task:reassign-created + ownership)
- `/dashboard/delete-task` - Delete tasks (task:delete-created + ownership)

#### Employee Only
- `/dashboard/update-task-status` - Update task status (task:update-status-assigned + ownership)

#### All Authenticated Users
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard access (account:view-profile)
- `/account/change-password` - Password change (account:change-password)

### Resource Ownership Validation
- Task operations require ownership validation
- Users can only access their own resources unless admin
- Business logic prevents unauthorized cross-user access

## Security Testing Recommendations

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test unauthenticated access to protected routes
   - Verify proper redirects to login page
   - Test session timeout behavior

2. **Authorization Testing**
   - Test role-based access controls
   - Verify permission-based restrictions
   - Test resource ownership validation

3. **Session Security Testing**
   - Test session integrity validation
   - Test session corruption handling
   - Verify session cleanup on security violations

4. **Rate Limiting Testing**
   - Test sensitive operation rate limits
   - Verify proper error responses
   - Test rate limit reset behavior

5. **Business Logic Testing**
   - Test task ownership restrictions
   - Test role-based business rules
   - Verify cross-user access prevention

## Compliance and Monitoring

- **Audit Trail**: All security events logged for compliance
- **Error Tracking**: Security violations tracked and monitored
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead with efficient middleware design
- **Scalability**: Session-based approach suitable for current architecture

## Maintenance and Updates

- **Permission Updates**: Modify `PERMISSIONS` object for role changes
- **Business Logic**: Update validators for new business rules
- **Security Headers**: Review and update headers as needed
- **Rate Limits**: Adjust limits based on usage patterns
